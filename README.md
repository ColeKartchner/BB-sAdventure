# Software Engineering Project
My final project in the Software Engineering class provided a valuable opportunity to gain insights into AGILE-style team collaboration in the context of a large-scale software project. Our task was to create an educational video game tailored for 1st and 2nd-grade students, aiming to improve their math skills.

In this project, I worked collaboratively with a team of three other designers to develop a video game using the Godot engine, with gameplay reminiscent of the classic game Galaga. The game mechanics were designed to be both engaging and educational: players had a limited number of shots, and to reload, they had to correctly answer math questions. We implemented a leveling system with progressively challenging math questions to cater to different skill levels. Moreover, we incorporated Google Play compatibility to enable a leaderboard where players could view high scores achieved by the students.

This assignment significantly contributed to my computer science and college-wide learning goals:

### System-Level Understanding of the Computer: 
The project allowed me to delve deeper into the technical aspects of game development, providing insights into how software interacts with computer systems and hardware.

### Concepts and Techniques of Software Design: 
I had never worked with Godot or any video game engine for that matter so this project gave me a good foundation for how to pick up a software and create something from scratch

### Project Experience in Group Setting: 
Collaborating within a team, each member had a specific role, and we had to coordinate our efforts to meet project milestones. This experience strengthened my ability to work effectively in a group, a crucial skill in the software development industry.

### Problem Solving Skills: 
Overcoming challenges related to game mechanics, educational content integration, and platform compatibility sharpened my problem-solving skills, enabling me to tackle complex issues systematically. 

In conclusion, this Software Engineering project not only expanded my knowledge in software design and development but also provided me with valuable insights into teamwork, project management, and problem-solvingâ€”aligning with my college's learning goals.
